Hi Ezra, one quick update: the militarization collaborator is interested in praetorian militarization = [(military spending in $)/(number of troops)/(GDP/c)].

This is his explanation:
 
There are three steps to creating the variable.
1)      military spending as a percent of GDP * GDP in constant dollars * conversion from percent to proportion
2)      Military expenditures divided by number of soldiers (corrected not to divide by zero).
3)      Expenditures per soldier divided by GDP per capita
 
Operationally:
1)      COMPUTE scf_milexp=wdi_expmilgdp * wdi_gdpcon*.01
2)      COMPUTE scf_ExpPerTroop=scf_milexp/(wdi_armedf +1)
3)      COMPUTE scf_Praetorian=scf_ExpPerTroop/(wdi_gdppccon)
 
There is also a logged version:
1)      COMPUTE scf_praetorianln=ln(scf_Praetorian)
